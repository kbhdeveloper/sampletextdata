Alexander Graham Bell was a Scottish-born Canadian-American inventor, scientist, and engineer2. He was born on March 3, 1847, in Edinburgh, Scotland, and passed away on August 2, 1922, in Beinn Bhreagh, Nova Scotia, Canada2.

Bell is best known for inventing the telephone, receiving the first U.S. patent for it on March 7, 1876. He also co-founded Bell Telephone Company, Bell Canada, and AT&T. His work extended beyond telecommunicationsâ€”he contributed to optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, aeronautics, and even heredity studies.

His family had a strong influence on his career. His father, grandfather, and brother were all involved in elocution and speech, and both his mother and wife were deaf, which shaped his lifelong interest in sound and communication
