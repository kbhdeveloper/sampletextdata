New Zealand's geography is characterized by two main islands, the North Island and the South Island, separated by the Cook Strait, along with numerous smaller islands. The country's varied terrain is shaped by tectonic activity and volcanic eruptions, featuring mountain ranges, fjords, lakes, and volcanic areas. The Southern Alps dominate the South Island, while a volcanic plateau covers much of the central North Island.
